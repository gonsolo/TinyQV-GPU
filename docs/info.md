The peripheral index is the number TinyQV will use to select your peripheral.  You will pick a free
slot when raising the pull request against the main TinyQV repository, and can fill this in then.  You
also need to set this value as the PERIPHERAL_NUM in your test script.

You can also include images in this folder and reference them in the markdown. Each image must be less than
